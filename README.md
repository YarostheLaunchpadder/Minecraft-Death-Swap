# Minecraft-Death-Swap
Minecraft, but every __ minutes you and your opponent switch places, prepare a trap for the other to get in. Who dies first loses!

Use /deathswap "opponent" "minutes" to start game (without actually writing "")

Or /endswap to stop the game forcibly.

- Tested on bukkit servers, not sure if works on spigot or paper core servers, but it should
- Minecraft version 1.14 and up (1.16.4 recommmended)
